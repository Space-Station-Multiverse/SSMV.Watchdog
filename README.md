Forked from [SS14.Watchdog](https://github.com/space-wizards/SS14.Watchdog), and mostly the same but with HTTP Auth support.

# SS14.Watchdog 

SS14.Watchdog is SS14's server-hosting wrapper thing, similar to [TGS](https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation-server) for BYOND (but much simpler for the time being). It handles auto updates, monitoring, automatic restarts, and administration. We recommend you use this for proper deployments.

Documentation on how setup and use for SS14.Watchdog is [here](https://docs.spacestation14.io/en/getting-started/hosting#watchdog).
